  ## wafer-- The wafer defect inspection system detects defects by comparing the image of the circuit patterns of the adjacent dies. As a result, systematic defects sometimes cannot be detected using a conventional wafer defect inspection system. Inspection can be performed on a patterned process wafer or on a bare wafer.
